# Profile Card Component

This project is a **Profile Card Component** built as part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The component displays a user's profile information, including their name, age, location, and social stats (followers, likes, and photos). The design is clean, responsive, and visually appealing, with a background pattern and modern typography.

## Features

- **Profile Card**: Displays user information, including name, age, location, and social stats.
- **Responsive Design**: The card is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Background Patterns**: Uses SVG background patterns for a visually appealing design.
- **Modern Typography**: Utilizes the "Kumbh Sans" font from Google Fonts for clean and modern typography.
- **Circular Profile Image**: The profile image is displayed in a circular format with a white border.
